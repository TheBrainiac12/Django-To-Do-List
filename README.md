# Django-To-Do-List
Django-To-Do-List is a todolist web application with the most basic features of most web apps, i.e. accounts/login, API and (somewhat) interactive UI.
## Installation
Try it out by installing the requirements. (Works only with python >= 3.4, due to django 2)

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Migrate:

    python manage.py migrate

And then start the server (default: http://localhost:8000)

    python manage.py runserver


Now you can browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/)
or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/)
